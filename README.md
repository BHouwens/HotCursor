# HotCursor

Heatmap tool to view user behaviour over time, for UX.

## What's the Point?

Usability testing can sometimes be expensive or inaccessible for a variety of reasons. Analytics are a great way of gathering user data remotely, but they can't give you a sense of the journeys and behaviours users make in an intuitive way, in "real time". 

The idea behind this is to give a designer a free, easy-to-setup remote usability testing tool, allowing them to view user journeys and behaviours across different desired parameters.

## Different Parameters?

Dan Formosa of the well-known industrial design company Smart Design introduced the concept of "designing for extremes" to many in the documentary _Objectified_. The idea goes that if you focus your design on the weakest user/s (read "slowest", "most erratic", "arthritic" etc) and the strongest (read the "fastest" etc) then the middle kind of takes care of itself.

This kind of idea makes sense for this tool if we think about these categorisations as ways of focussing on the heatmaps we actually want to see. Thus, we could say that a parameter we are interested in is the slowest person, and the tool should be able to present the us with the 5 slowest people we have heatmaps on. We could then inspect these in-depth and likely discover exactly *why* they are the slowest.

This is where the proper power and utility of this kind of tool comes in.
